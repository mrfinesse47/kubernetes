Yes, you can use `kubectl get` to retrieve the running deployment configuration and then redirect the output into a YAML file for editing. Here's how you can do it:

1. Get the current deployment configuration and save it to a file:

```bash
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -o yaml > updated-deployment.yaml
```

Replace `<deployment-name>` with the name of your deployment.

2. Open the `updated-deployment.yaml` file in your preferred text editor (e.g., Vi, Nano, or any text editor of your choice):

```bash
vi updated-deployment.yaml
```

3. Make the necessary changes to the image or any other part of the YAML file.

4. Save your changes and exit the text editor.

5. Apply the updated deployment configuration to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f updated-deployment.yaml
```

This approach allows you to edit the deployment configuration in an external file while preserving the original configuration in case you need to roll back to it.
