Yes, that's correct. If you have a readiness probe defined in a Pod and the probe fails, Kubernetes will consider the container in the Pod as "not ready." This means that the Pod, as a whole, will be marked as "not ready" as well. If you didn't have the readiness probe, Kubernetes would consider the Pod as "ready" regardless of the actual readiness of the container inside.

The key point is that readiness probes are used to indicate when a container is ready to accept traffic or requests. If the readiness probe fails, it signals to Kubernetes that the container is not ready to handle traffic, and as a result, the Pod is also considered "not ready." This prevents new traffic from being directed to the container until it becomes ready.

On the other hand, liveness probes are used to determine if a container is still running as expected. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will kill the container and start a new one. Liveness probes are about ensuring that the container is healthy and functioning correctly, while readiness probes are about determining when the container is ready to serve traffic.

By using both readiness and liveness probes appropriately, you can ensure that your applications are both available to receive traffic and reliable in the face of unexpected issues.
