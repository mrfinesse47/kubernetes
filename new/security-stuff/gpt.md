In Kubernetes, by default, Pods run with a non-root user. The exact user and group are determined by the container runtime being used in the cluster.

In Docker, which is one of the most commonly used container runtimes with Kubernetes, the default user is `root`. However, Kubernetes enhances security by overriding the default user and group within the container. Kubernetes does this by setting the user and group ID for the container process to an arbitrarily assigned non-root user, typically with a user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) of 1000 or higher.

This practice of using a non-root user as the default helps enhance security by reducing the potential impact of a security breach. Containers running as non-root users have fewer privileges and restrictions on what they can do within the container and the underlying host system.

Keep in mind that while the default user is non-root, you can still configure your Pods to run as specific users or groups by defining the `securityContext` in the Pod or container specification. Additionally, if you use a different container runtime or customize your Kubernetes cluster's configuration, the default behavior may vary.

To check the default user and group ID for containers in your Kubernetes cluster, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].securityContext.runAsUser}'
```

Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of the Pod you want to inspect. This command will display the user ID (UID) of the container's default user.

Remember that managing user and group IDs within containers is an important aspect of container security and isolation. It's essential to consider your specific security requirements and policies when configuring user and group IDs for your Pods and containers in Kubernetes.
